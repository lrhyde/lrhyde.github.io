- This is my portfolio website, logging my experiences in software engineering and various personal and academic projects I've completed.
- This site was built entirely from scratch, mostly during the summer after my senior year of high school, and it uses pure HTML/CSS/JS
- To learn more about any of the projects listed, email me at lrhyde2@illinois.edu or reach out on LinkedIn :)
